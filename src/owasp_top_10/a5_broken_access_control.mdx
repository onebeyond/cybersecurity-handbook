# A5 Broken Access Control


## Definition

Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced.
Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access
other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.

## Risk Factor Summary

- Score: 6.0
- Attack Vectors Exploitability: 2
- Security Weakness Prevalence: 2
- Security Weakness Detectability: 2
- Impact Technical: 3

## Context

Exploitation of access control is a
core skill of attackers. SAST and
DAST tools can detect the absence of
access control but cannot verify if it is
functional when it is present. Access
control is detectable using manual
means, or possibly through
automation for the absence of access
controls in certain frameworks.

Access control weaknesses are common due to the
lack of automated detection, and lack of effective
functional testing by application developers.
Access control detection is not typically amenable to
automated static or dynamic testing. Manual testing
is the best way to detect missing or ineffective
access control, including HTTP method (GET vs
PUT, etc), controller, direct object references, etc.

The technical impact is attackers
acting as users or administrators, or
users using privileged functions, or
creating, accessing, updating or
deleting every record.
The business impact depends on the
protection needs of the application
and data.


## Is the Application Vulnerable?

Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act
outside of their intended permissions. Failures typically lead to
unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction
of all data, or performing a business function outside of the limits
of the user. Common access control vulnerabilities include:
- Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL,
internal application state, or the HTML page, or simply using a
custom API attack tool.
- Allowing the primary key to be changed to another users
record, permitting viewing or editing someone else's account.
- Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in,
or acting as an admin when logged in as a user.
- Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a
JSON Web Token (JWT) access control token or a cookie or
hidden field manipulated to elevate privileges, or abusing JWT
invalidation
- CORS misconfiguration allows unauthorized API access.
- Force browsing to authenticated pages as an unauthenticated
user or to privileged pages as a standard user. Accessing API
with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.

## How to Prevent

Access control is only effective if enforced in trusted server-side
code or server-less API, where the attacker cannot modify the
access control check or metadata.
- With the exception of public resources, deny by default.
- Implement access control mechanisms once and re-use them
throughout the application, including minimizing CORS usage.
- Model access controls should enforce record ownership, rather
than accepting that the user can create, read, update, or delete
any record.
- Unique application business limit requirements should be
enforced by domain models.
- Disable web server directory listing and ensure file metadata
(e.g. .git) and backup files are not present within web roots.
- Log access control failures, alert admins when appropriate
(e.g. repeated failures).
- Rate limit API and controller access to minimize the harm from
automated attack tooling.
- JWT tokens should be invalidated on the server after logout.
Developers and QA staff should include functional access control
unit and integration tests.

## Example Attack Scenarios

### Scenario #1: 
The application uses unverified data in a SQL call
that is accessing account information:

```
pstmt.setString(1, request.getParameter("acct"));
ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );
```

An attacker simply modifies the 'acct' parameter in the browser to
send whatever account number they want. If not properly
verified, the attacker can access any user's account.

```
http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct
```


### Scenario #2: 
An attacker simply force browses to target URLs.
Admin rights are required for access to the admin page.

```
http://example.com/app/getappInfo
http://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo
```

If an unauthenticated user can access either page, it’s a flaw. If a
non-admin can access the admin page, this is a flaw.
